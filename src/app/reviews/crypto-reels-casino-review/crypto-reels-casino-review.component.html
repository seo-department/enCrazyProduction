                            <p>Crypto Reels, as the name suggests, is an online casino that focuses on using cryptocurrencies. Many gamblers have gravitated towards using crypto due to the complete anonymity offered. However, what else does the Crypto Reels offer besides using Bitcoin?
                            We sent through our review team to spend some time with Crypto Reels to see how it stacks up against other casinos. Let&rsquo;s see how good Crypto Reels stacks up!</p>
                            <h2>Casinos Similar to Crypto Reels</h2>
                            <app-main-table></app-main-table>
                            <h2>Crypto Reels Casino Bonuses and Promotions</h2>
                            <p>Things certainly start on a positive note with Crypto Reels. A quick glance at the bonuses reveals plenty of offers for both new and returning players. When signing up, new players will be treated to a Welcome Bonus of 450% up to $4500 on their first
                            deposit. The Welcome Bonus can only be used on slot games and requires a minimum deposit of $10. There is also a 50x wagering requirement on the bonus, which is higher than we would have liked to see. If players use Bitcoin to make their first deposit,
                            they will also be given an additional $75 free.</p>
                            <p>The bonuses don&rsquo;t stop there; returning players will be able to top off their bankroll with various reload bonuses and free spins. All in all, Crypto Reels offers some great bonuses, and players will not feel disappointed with the bonuses on offer.</p>
                            <h2>Crypto Reels Customer Support</h2>
                            <p>Online casinos operate 24-hours a day, so there are always players having a good time. No one wants a late-night gambling session to be interrupted by technical issues and then need to wait until normal business hours. Thankfully, Crypto Reels understands
                            this and offers customer support that is available 24/7.</p>
                            <p>Should you require assistance, you can contact the support team via Live Chat, email, or telephone. There is also a FAQ page, which should be a player&rsquo;s first stop if they have issues. There will be many common issues and queries listed here, and
                            you may just find the answer without needing support. However, if you cannot find help on the FAQ page, then the support staff is ready and waiting to be of assistance.</p>
                            <h2>Banking Options at Crypto Reels</h2>
                            <p>As the name suggests, Crypto Reels focuses on using cryptocurrencies for banking. However, there are still other banking options on offer. As popular as crypto has become, there are still many who do not use it. It is great to see that Crypto Reels caters
                            to those players as well. Below is a breakdown of all the deposit options offered at Crypto Reels Casino.</p>
