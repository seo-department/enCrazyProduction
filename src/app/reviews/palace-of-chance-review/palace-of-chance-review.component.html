                            <h2>Palace of Chance Banking Methods</h2>
                            <p>Palace of Chance understands that their player base is filled with a dynamic set of individuals who may prefer to use different banking methods. It is for this reason that they provide players with a wide range of deposit and withdrawal methods. Here
                            is a full breakdown of every method available:</p>
                            <h3>Deposit Methods</h3>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Visa and Mastercard</li>
                            <li>Neteller (not available in USA)</li>
                            <li>Bitcoin</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Withdrawal Methods</h3>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Neteller (not available in USA)</li>

                            <li>BankWire</li>
                            <li>BankChecks</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>With regards to withdrawals, it is important to note that players are limited to a maximum payout of US$2000. It is possible to raise this limit if you become a VIP player. In addition, upon requesting a withdrawal, players will be required to verify
                            their personal details, such as email, physical address, and phone numbers.</p>
                            <p>One area of concern is that there is no estimated timeframe given for payouts. It is stated that your payout time is largely dependent on the banking method used, with Bitcoin and e-wallets being much faster than other options.</p>

                            <p>Palace of Chance has a lot to offer US players in terms of online casino gaming. Some highlights include a large gaming library, a mobile-compatible site, and a no rules weekly bonus for existing players. However, that said, they do have a rather high
                            wagering requirement for bonuses and the uncertainty around payout speed is a large drawback. It is for this reason we have decided to rate Palace of Chance casino three out five.</p>
