                            <app-main-table></app-main-table>
                            <h2>Craps Tip 1 &ndash; Set Loss Limits</h2>
                            <p>Before players start playing, it is a good idea to set a loss limit. This means after players have lost the set amount, they should walk away. Setting a budget is also a good way for players to keep track of their spending.</p>
                            <h2>Craps Tip 2 &ndash; Start Off Small</h2>
                            <p>When it comes to placing bets, the amount a player wagers usually depends on the budget. However, it is always a good idea to start off with small bets. In games like craps, it is just as easy to lose large amounts of money, as it is to win. For players
                            who are completely new to the game, it may be worth starting with off by placing the smallest bets possible and working your way to bigger bets as you get more familiar with the game.</p>
                            <h2>Craps Tip 3 &ndash; Pass Line and Come Bets</h2>
                            <p>The pass line and come bet has one of the lowest house edges in craps. The house edge for these bets is 1.41%, which makes it an excellent choice for any player.</p>
                            <h2>Craps Tip 4 - Don&rsquo;t Come Bet and Don&rsquo;t Pass Line Bet</h2>
                            <p>The house edge for the Don&rsquo;t Come Bet and Don&rsquo;t Pass Line Bet is a mere 1.40%. Many players do not feel comfortable playing these bets. But with such a low house edge, players have plenty to gain from them</p>
                            <h2>Craps Tip 5 &ndash; Odds Bet</h2>
                            <p>This is one of the best bets to play when it comes to craps. This bet has no house advantage! However, as you will expect with a bet that has zero house edge, there is a catch. This bet can only be played after the Pass Line, Come, Don&rsquo;t Come, and
                            Don&rsquo;t Pass Line bets. This is one of many reasons why players prefer to play craps. There is more than one round of betting.</p>
                            <h2>Craps Tip 6 &ndash; 6 and 8 Bets</h2>
                            <p>The 6 and 8 bets are not always the best to play. However, they do have a way of rewarding players generously. The house edge for these is 1.52%. It is worth it to point out with these bets; players are required to place these bets at $6 increments. This
                            is, until, the bet reaches $20, then $3 increases per bet are allowed.</p>
                            <h2>Craps Tip 7 &ndash; Don&rsquo;t 6 and Don&rsquo;t 8 Bets</h2>
                            <p>These bets are also referred to as No 6 and No 8. With these bets, players are placing a bet that a 7 will be rolled before a 6 or 8. The significance if that 7 is the strongest number in a game of craps. With these bets, the house edge is a mere 1.82%,
                            which gives players a good chance of winning. &nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>Craps Tip 8 &ndash; Claim Craps Bonuses</h2>
                            <p>Many casinos offer players exciting bonuses to keep them at the casino. These bonuses increase the player&rsquo;s bankroll and help them stretch it a little further. In addition, many casinos also offer players loyalty programs that earn players points.
                            In return, players may redeem these points for credit to play games such as craps.</p>
                            <h2>Craps Tip 9 &ndash; Don&rsquo;t Play Back All Your Winnings</h2>
                            <p>Winning can create a large amount of enthusiasm and excitement for players. It is also easy to get carried away and think you need to continue playing. However, this is not the case. It is always good to set aside some of the winnings and request a withdrawal.
                            This way, players get to use their winnings on something that they have been saving for.</p>
                            <h2>Craps Tip 10 &ndash; Focus on Having Fun</h2>
                            <p>Craps is a very fast-paced table game. It is easy for players to get consumed by everything that is happening. However, it can also be a very enjoyable game. That is, we saved our best tip for last. &nbsp;Do not get caught up in everything happening at
                            the craps table, instead, try focusing on the enjoyment of the game. It is one of the most social games players can take part, if you are playing at a land-based casino. So, win or lose, just have fun, consider winning as a bonus.</p>
